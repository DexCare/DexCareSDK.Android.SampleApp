# DexCareSDK.Android.SampleApp
An Android sample app using the DexCare SDK.

To get started, open the config.xml files and replace the values with the configs provided to you by the DexCare team.

You will also need to set two environment variables in order to have access to the DexCare SDK downloads:

`DEXCARE_MAVEN_ACCOUNT` - Your authorized GitHub username or email

`DEXCARE_MAVEN_TOKEN` - Your GitHub personal access token or password

After these are set, restart Android Studio and do a Gradle sync.  The DexCare SDK dependency should then download successfully.
